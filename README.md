# FitBod Interview Challenge

## Author: Rob Booth

When approaching this challenge I started by just embedding the CSV file into the application. I then converted the CSV data into JSON and decoded into objects for easy use at runtime.  To do this I add a header row in code to the supplied CSV data before parsing. To add your own test data file just replace **workouts.csv** with your data.

I considered building a local database of the rows from the CSV file using SwiftData but decided that was overkill for this tech challenge.

Thank you for taking the time to review my work.
